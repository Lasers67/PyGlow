PyGlow is a Python package which attempts to implement Keras like API functionalities on PyTorch backend with functionalities supporting information theoretic methods which are relevant for understanding neural network dynamics. The package is equipped with a number of state-of-the-art algorithms for estimating and calculating various kinds of information theoretic measures and quantities. Along with traditional dependence criterion for random variables like mutual information, PyGlow also have newer dependence criterion like HSIC criterion which have proved to be more robust in terms of 'Information Bottleneck Theory of Deep Learning'. 

# What's new with PyGlow ?

PyGlow provide support for the following features of the 'IB theory of Deep Learning':

- Functionalities for experimental IB-based DNN analysis
- Test IB-based DNN performance bounds
- Flexible API structure to test theoretical ideas and hypothesis related to IB-theory or information theory in general
- IB-based training paradigms of DNN
- Flexible internal pipeline which allows for the implementation of custom user-defined dependence criterions or IB-based loss functions
