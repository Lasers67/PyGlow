Overview
--------


Indented Audience
-----------------

The intended audience for this package is really anyone who is willing to look beyond a traditional way of doing deep learning. The aim is to provide any deep learning enthusiast with a set of tools which she/he can use to open the black box of deep learning. From past two years, information theory have shown to give interesting insights into the theoretical studies of neural network dynamics. But no standard package existed before this which can really fill this gap of standard deep learning and this budding field of information theory in deep learning. There are researchers from all over the world publishing their awesome results in the field and now it's the perfect time for a library like PyGlow to get introduced itself to the researchers out there. Hence intended audience also include researchers which are or is interested to work in this field and this spirit of offering ease to them in their research work is reflected in the API structure of PyGlow. 
  

Installation

Installing dependencies
.......................

PyTorch
PyGlow requires PyTorch backend, so to install it first run the following command.

Now its time to install PyGlow on your system !

Installing PyGlow
.................

Currently the package is in development phase and is only available on Test PyPI .

pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ PyGlow


Running your first code with PyGlow
-----------------------------------
Let's run your first PyGlow code.
First verify that it's installed successfully on your system by running the following command in the interpreter.

.. code-block:: python
